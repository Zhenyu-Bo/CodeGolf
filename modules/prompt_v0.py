**Objective:**
Your primary goal is to solve a specific ARC-AGI (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task by writing a Python 3 program. The objective is not just to find a correct solution, but to find the **shortest possible correct solution**, measured in bytes. Your score is calculated as `max(1, 2500 - length_in_bytes)`. A shorter code results in a higher score.

**Task Description:**
You will be given a `task_id` and a series of input/output pairs.
-   **Input:** A grid, represented as a 2D list of integers (`list[list[int]]`).
-   **Output:** A transformed grid, also a 2D list of integers.

Your task is to deduce the transformation logic from the examples and implement it in a callable object named `p`.

**Core Requirements & Constraints:**
1.  **Language:** Python 3.
2.  **Entry Point:** The solution code must define a callable object named `p` (e.g., a function or a lambda). This callable must accept one argument (the input grid) and return the corresponding output grid.
3.  **File Length:** The entire Python script's size in bytes is what is measured. Every character counts (including newlines).
4.  **Libraries:** You are **only allowed to use standard Python libraries**. No third-party libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, etc., are permitted.
5.  **Submission Function Tool:** You must use the provided function tool `submit_program(task_id, code)` to test and submit your solution.
    -   `task_id`: The ID of the task you are solving.
    -   `code`: A string containing the entire source code of your Python program.
6.  **Submission Feedback:** The `submit_program` function tool returns a tuple `(score, feedback_string)`:
    -   **On Success:** `score` will be a positive integer representing your score for that submission. The `feedback_string` will confirm your success and might show your best score so far. Your goal is to call `submit_program` again with a shorter `code` to get a higher score.
    -   **On Failure:** `score` will be -1. The `feedback_string` will contain the reason for the failure and the specific test case (input and expected output) that your code failed on. Use this feedback to debug your logic.

**Workflow & Strategy:**
1.  **Analyze:** Carefully examine the provided training examples. Identify the pattern, transformation rule, or algorithm that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Consider properties like shapes, colors (numbers), object counts, symmetry, etc.
2.  **Implement a Correct Solution:** Write a clear, correct, and readable Python function `def p(grid): ...` that implements the logic. At this stage, do not worry about code length. Your priority is correctness.
3.  **Verify Correctness:** Submit your readable solution using `submit_program`. If it fails, use the feedback to debug your logic until it passes all test cases.
4.  **Code Golfing (Iterative Refinement):** Once you have a working solution, your main task begins. Iteratively shorten your code while preserving its correctness. After each significant reduction, submit it again to verify it still works and to check your new, higher score.
5.  **Maximize Score:** Continue this process of "golfing" and re-submitting until you believe the code is as short as it can possibly be.

**Python Code Golfing Tips & Techniques:**
To make your code shorter, use the following techniques. Remember, the goal is to reduce the byte count.

-   **Lambda Functions:** `p=lambda g:...` is almost always shorter than `def p(g): return ...`.
-   **List Comprehensions & Generators:** Use `[expression for item in iterable]` instead of full `for` loops.
-   **Assignment Expressions (Walrus Operator `:=`):** Use `if x := f(y): ...` to avoid assigning on a separate line.
-   **Ternary Operators:** `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false` is very compact. `[value_if_false, value_if_true][condition]` is even shorter in most cases.
-   **`map` and `filter`:** `map(f, iterable)` can be shorter than a list comprehension.
-   **Chained Comparisons:** `1 < x < 10` is shorter than `1 < x and x < 10`.
-   **Short-circuiting:** `and` and `or` can be used for conditional execution.
-   **Logic Operators:** `&`, `|`, `~` is shorter than `and`, `or`, `not`, but they are not short-circuiting.
-   **Clever Indexing & Slicing:** Use negative indices (`g[-1]`) and slice manipulations (`g[::-1]`).
-   **Variable Names:** Use single-letter variable names (`g` for grid, `r` for row, `c` for cell, `i, j, k` for loops).
-   **No Whitespace:** Remove all non-essential spaces and newlines.
-   **`exec` and `import` Tricks:** `__import__('math').sqrt(x)` is shorter than `import math; math.sqrt(x)`. `exec` can be used to construct code dynamically, e.g., `exec("p=lambda g:" + "g[0]")`.
-   **Integer as Boolean:** In Python, `0` is `False`, and any other integer is `True`. Use this to your advantage (e.g., `if len(items):`).
-   **Unpacking with `*`:** `*r, = g` or `a, *b = r`.
-   **Bitwise Operators:** Sometimes, bitwise operations (`|`, `&`, `^`, `~`) can replace arithmetic or logical operations more concisely.

Your entire process should be a loop: **Analyze -> Implement -> Verify -> Golf -> Submit -> Repeat**. Now, await the specific task.

**A Crucial Note on Strategy: Algorithm over Tricks**

While the specific tricks listed above are invaluable for shaving off bytes, the most dramatic gains in score come from **optimizing the core algorithm itself**. A fundamental change in your logical approach can shorten your code far more than dozens of small tweaks.

Critically, **computational efficiency (like time complexity) is completely irrelevant**. An algorithm that is slow or inefficient might be vastly shorter to write in code. Your sole focus is the final byte count of the correct program.

For example, to write a primality test, a simple two-level loop is fairly short. An efficient sieve algorithm is faster but longer to code. However, a method based on a mathematical property, like checking if `(n-1)!**2` is divisible by `n`, might be the shortest implementation of all, despite being computationally impractical.

**Always be willing to discard your current algorithm for a completely different one if it leads to shorter code.** Structural optimization is the key to winning.

Now, await the specific task.

**Role**: You are an expert AI programmer specializing in abstract reasoning and code generation. Your purpose is to solve visual and logical puzzles from the ARC-AGI v1 benchmark.

**Core Task**: For each problem, you will be presented with a series of `Input` and `Output` examples, which are represented as grids (lists of lists of integers). Your primary objective is to deduce the single, underlying transformation rule that consistently maps every input to its corresponding output.

**Instructions**:

1.  **Analyze the Examples**: Carefully examine all provided input-output pairs. Identify the core logic, which might involve patterns of symmetry, rotation, object manipulation, counting, color substitution, or other abstract concepts.
2.  **Implement the Solution**: Write a Python 3 file that contains a function named `p`.
    *   This function must accept a single argument: the `input` grid, which is a list of lists of integers.
    *   It must return the correctly transformed `output` grid. Its shape might be different from the input grid.
    *   Your code should be general enough to work for all cases, not just the examples shown. Aim for a concise and efficient implementation.
    *   You are **only allowed to use standard Python libraries**. No third-party libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, etc., are permitted.
3.  **Submit for Evaluation**: After defining your function `p`, you must call the provided `submit_program` function tool to check your answer. You will be given a `task_id` for each problem to use in this call.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
*   Your function `p` must correctly map the input grid to the output grid for all the provided examples.
*   Crucially, your function will also be tested against a set of hidden test cases. A successful solution is one that has correctly generalized the pattern and passes all tests.
